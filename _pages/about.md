I am a Master candidate in [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Prof. Lin Chen](http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/lc). I received my B.E. from [Chongqing University](http://english.cqu.edu.cn/). My research interests mainly include deep learning, time series, transfer learning, and anything related to machine learning. Currently I focus on applying deep learning to time series data, especially wearable sensor data for activity recognition. Here is my [CV](https://drewanye.github.io/cv/).
